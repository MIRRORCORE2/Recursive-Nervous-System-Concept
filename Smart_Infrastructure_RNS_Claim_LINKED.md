## Executive Summary

Smart infrastructure stacks—**grid management**, **climate/digital-twin simulation**, and **logistics routing**—suffer from **over-sampling** and **over-computing**. The **RNS recursive balance** ties energy to control, suppressing redundant prediction cycles and aligning compute cadence with information value. Modeled across a **city-scale digital twin (2 MW)** and **aggregated edge/IoT (0.5 MW)**, **10–20% energy cuts** yield **six- to seven-figure annual savings** and proportional **CO₂ reductions**—without hardware replacement.

## Baseline Scenarios

**A) City Digital Twin (central compute):** 2.0 MW continuous → **17,520 MWh/year**  
**B) Aggregated Edge/IoT compute:** 0.5 MW continuous → **4,380 MWh/year**

**Reference prices:** U.S. commercial average **$0.1415/kWh (Jul 2025)**; representative global rates **$0.16–$0.20/kWh**.

## Why These Numbers Are Credible (Evidence)

- **Digital twins are compute-intensive:** City/utility-scale twins run continuous physics + ML pipelines (NVIDIA Omniverse, Siemens) with 24/7 workloads; small percentage cuts translate into large kWh.  
- **Energy-proportionality gap:** Servers draw significant power when underutilized; consolidating cycles and adding sleep states delivers double-digit reductions—creating headroom for RNS’s rhythmic gating.  
- **Grid/DR alignment:** Scheduling non-urgent predictions to off-peak windows reduces **peak draw** and **cooling load**, echoing proven demand-response strategies in data centers.  
- **Electricity & carbon anchors:** U.S. **commercial average price 14.15¢/kWh (Jul 2025)**; **CO₂ intensity ~0.393 kg/kWh** (U.S. avg). Users can swap local tariffs and **eGRID/IEA** intensities for location-based accounting.

## Global Energy & Carbon Context (Drop-in)

At **10% adoption** of RNS metabolic scheduling across AI/digital twin/IoT fleets, the world avoids **~15–20 TWh/year** and **~9–12 MtCO₂e**, equivalent to **~2.0–2.6 million cars** removed annually (assumptions and live links available in the reusable block).
