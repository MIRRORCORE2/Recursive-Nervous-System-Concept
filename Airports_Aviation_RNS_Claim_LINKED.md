# Airports & Aviation Operations Claim — RNS Rhythmic Control for BHS, Terminals & Airside  
**Public Claim of Origination | Number-Heavy Economics**

**Signature:** Joshua Wilson — Architect & Originator of the RNS™, MirrorCore²

## Executive Summary

Airports are **continuous-load campuses**: **baggage handling systems (BHS)**, **terminal HVAC/fans/pumps**, **lighting/IT**, and **airside electrification** for gates and GSE. These systems often **over-sample** (controls/SCADA polling), **over-compute** (duplicate routing/planning), and **over-run** equipment (conveyors/fans at fixed duty). **RNS metabolic loops** throttle redundant cycles, sequence baggage/air handling in **calm rhythms**, and shift non-urgent compute to off-peak. Modeled **10–30% energy cuts** deliver **multi-million-dollar annual savings** and proportional **CO₂ reductions**—no hardware replacement required.

## Baselines

**A) Large hub:** 20 MW continuous → **175,200 MWh/year**  
**B) Mid-size airport:** 5 MW continuous → **43,800 MWh/year**

**Reference electricity prices:** U.S. commercial average **$0.1415/kWh (Jul 2025)**; representative global rates **$0.16–$0.20/kWh**.

## What RNS Changes (Mechanisms)

- **BHS conveyor pacing & sleeps:** collapse idle spans; group bag runs; leverage variable-speed and stop/start windows.  
- **Terminal HVAC rhythm:** align fans/pumps/air handlers to occupancy & thermal inertia; small speed cuts → large kWh (fan cube law).  
- **Airside electrification scheduling:** coordinate **GSE charging** and **gate PCA/400 Hz** loads with off-peak windows.  
- **Repair-first retries:** localize faults (e.g., jam sensors) before full-system restarts.

## Why These Numbers Hold (Evidence)

- **Airport energy intensity & savings programs:** ACI/FAA/DOE Better Buildings document large HVAC/conveyor opportunities via controls and VFDs.  
- **Conveyor/fan laws:** Affinity/cube-law relationships make speed reductions disproportionately powerful.  
- **Electricity & carbon anchors:** U.S. **$0.1415/kWh (Jul 2025)**; **0.393 kg CO₂/kWh** U.S. average; swap local tariffs and **IEA** factors for location-based accounting.

## Global Energy & Carbon Context (Drop-in)

At **10% adoption** of RNS metabolic control across airports, **~15–20 TWh/year** and **~9–12 MtCO₂e** are avoided globally—roughly **2.0–2.6 million cars** off-road annually.
