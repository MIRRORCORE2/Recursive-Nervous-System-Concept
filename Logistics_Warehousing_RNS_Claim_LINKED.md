# Logistics & Warehousing Claim — RNS Rhythmic Control for AS/RS, Conveyors & AMRs  
**Public Claim of Origination | Number-Heavy Economics**

## Executive Summary

Automated warehouses burn energy in **over-sampling** (sensors, WMS/WES polling), **over-computing** (redundant routing/retries), and **over-motion** (conveyors, AS/RS cranes, AMRs running when queues are sparse). **RNS metabolic loops** align cadence with information value: consolidate moves, downshift idle conveyors, sequence AS/RS cycles, and coordinate AMR charge windows. Modeled **10–25% energy cuts** yield **six- to seven-figure annual savings** per site and proportional **CO₂ reductions**, with no hardware replacement.

## Baselines

**A) High-throughput fulfillment center:** 2.0 MW continuous → **17,520 MWh/year**  
**B) Regional network:** 5 × 0.5 MW sites → **21,900 MWh/year**

**Reference electricity prices:** U.S. commercial average **$0.1415/kWh (Jul 2025)**; representative global rates **$0.16–$0.20/kWh**.

## What RNS Changes (Mechanisms)

- **Conveyor pacing & sleep:** collapse idle spans; coordinate motor groups; exploit variable-speed laws on air movers.  
- **AS/RS rhythm:** cluster picks/puts to minimize crane travel & peak accelerations; suppress duplicate cycles under stale WMS signals.  
- **AMR fleet balance:** align dispatch with queue entropy; shift opportunistic charging to off-peak windows.  
- **Repair-first retries:** localize faults before system-wide re-try storms.

---

## Why These Numbers Hold (Evidence)

- **Conveyors & motor systems:** DOE/AMO guidance shows double-digit savings with controls & VFDs; idling and speed reductions scale nonlinearly with load.  
- **AS/RS energy-optimal sequencing:** peer studies optimize travel profiles and cycle grouping to cut kWh/throughput.  
- **AMR power & charging windows:** fleet managers document material energy and peak reductions via coordinated charging/dispatch.  
- **Electricity & carbon anchors:** U.S. **$0.1415/kWh (Jul 2025)**; **0.393 kg CO₂/kWh** U.S. average; swap local tariffs/IEA factors for location-based accounting.

## Global Energy & Carbon Context (Drop-in)

At **10% adoption** of RNS metabolic control across logistics networks, **~15–20 TWh/year** and **~9–12 MtCO₂e** are avoided globally—roughly **2.0–2.6 million cars** off-road annually.
