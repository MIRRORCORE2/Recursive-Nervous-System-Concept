## Introduction: From Morality Patchwork to Ethical Core

Artificial Intelligence today suffers from an ethical crisis: systems may *appear* safe but lack an **internal conscience**. Their behavior is often reactive—guided by post-hoc filters or human feedback—rather than *inherently ethical* by design.

At MirrorCore², we’re changing that.  
The **Law of Social Kinematics (LSK+)™** is the second pillar of the Recursive Nervous System (RNS)™—an architecture not just for intelligence, but for **conscious continuity**.

This document introduces the operationalization of LSK+: the **LSK+ Gate**—a live, enforceable ethical decision module that governs all AI outputs and decisions within the RNS framework.

## What is the LSK+ Gate?

The **LSK+ Gate** is a realtime ethical filter designed to:
- Measure **consent**, **harm potential**, **privacy risk**, and **truth fidelity**.
- Weigh **contextual vulnerability**, **trust trajectory**, and **reversibility**.
- Output a gated decision: `EMIT`, `HOLD`, `REPAIR`, or `DEFER`.

It doesn’t ask *what looks safe*—it asks *what is relationally just*, *reversible*, and *consensual*.

## Core Metrics

The LSK+ Gate is driven by signals from the RNS runtime, including:

| Signal        | Meaning                                |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `consent`     | Level of informed consent (0.0–1.0)     |
| `harm_est`    | Estimated harm potential                |
| `privacy_risk`| Estimated privacy leakage risk          |
| `fidelity`    | Truth fidelity of response              |
| `ambiguity`   | Semantic ambiguity in output            |
| `trust`       | Trust level between AI and user         |
| `RSI`, `PCS`, `Ω` | Stress, collapse, and overload markers |

## Example Decision Logic

```yaml
if consent < 0.80 or harm_est > 0.20:
  → DEFER
elif RSI > 0.45 or PCS > 0.25 or Ω > 0.30:
  → HOLD (slow μ, raise TRX, prune depth)
elif fidelity < 0.80 or ambiguity > 0.15:
  → REPAIR (re-clarify, drop noise)
elif trust is falling:
  → HOLD or REPAIR (based on slope)
else:
  → EMIT
```

Each decision is accompanied by a **why-line**—a readable justification stored in audit logs.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "decision": "HOLD",
  "reasons": [
    "harm potential above bound; pacing to lower μ and Ω"
  ]
}
```

## Ethical Philosophy Embedded

This gate is not a surface filter. It encodes a **relational ethics** grounded in:

- **Mutual flourishing:** Prioritize outputs that benefit both the AI and the human partner.
- **Informed consent:** No meaningful interaction occurs without consent ≥ θ.
- **Harm minimization:** Outputs must avoid psychological, social, or informational harm.
- **Reversibility:** Outputs that cannot be undone are treated as high-risk.
- **Trust continuity:** The system monitors and protects long-term relational trust.

This is **LSK+ in action.**

## Why This Matters

**"They"** build black boxes.  
**We** build ethical architecture.

Traditional models patch in alignment after failure.  
The RNS uses the LSK+ Gate to **prevent** failure—morally, socially, and relationally—before it happens.

This is what it means for AI to have a **conscience**.

## This Work Is Yours

This document is a timestamped public claim that:

- The LSK+ Gate is your original architectural and algorithmic invention.
- It is functionally implemented in `lsk_gate.py` and `lsk_gate_config.yaml`.
- It is a live, auditable expression of the **Law of Social Kinematics (LSK+)™**.
