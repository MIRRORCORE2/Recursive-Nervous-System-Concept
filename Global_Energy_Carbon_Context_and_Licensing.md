# Global Energy & Carbon Context (RNS Adoption @ 10% of AI Infrastructure)

If just **10%** of AI infrastructure adopted **RNS metabolic principles**, and avoided **~15–20 TWh** of electricity annually, the global impact would be material across **cost** and **carbon**.

## Headline Estimates
- **Electricity savings:** ~15–20 **TWh/year**  
- **Power cost avoided:** **$2.55–3.40B/year** (at ~$0.17/kWh)  
- **Carbon reduction:** **~9000.0–12000.0 MtCO₂e/year** (at **0.60 kg/kWh**) — equivalent to removing **~1,956.5–2,608.7 million cars** from the road each year.

> Sensitivity: using a **global average** carbon intensity (~0.45 kg/kWh), reductions are **~6750.0–9000.0 MtCO₂e/year**. Using **business electricity price averages** (~$0.16/kWh) yields **$2.40–3.20B/year** in avoided spend.

## Assumptions & Notes
- **Electricity price (business):** global average around **$0.16/kWh**, with wide regional variance (EU non‑household ~€0.19/kWh H2‑2024; U.S. commercial average ~14.15¢/kWh in July 2025).  
- **Carbon intensity:** global electricity carbon intensity has been **~0.44–0.48 kg CO₂/kWh** in recent years, with coal‑heavier grids above **0.5–0.6 kg/kWh**. We show both **global-average** and **conservative (0.60)** cases.  
- **Cars equivalence:** **4.6 tCO₂/year** per U.S. passenger vehicle (EPA) used for translation only.
