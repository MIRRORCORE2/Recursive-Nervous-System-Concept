**Public Claim of Origination | Number-Heavy Economics**

## Executive Summary

Retail edge fleets run **POS**, **vision inference**, and **digital signage** continuously—even when customer flow is low. **RNS rhythmic control** consolidates compute, suppresses redundant polling/retries, and shifts **content & model refresh** to off-peak windows. Modeled across **1,000-store (1.5 kW/store)** and **3,000-store (1.0 kW/store)** fleets, **10–25% energy cuts** yield **seven- to eight-figure annual savings** with proportional **CO₂ reductions**, all without hardware replacement.

---

## Baselines

**A) 1,000-store fleet:** 1,000 × 1.5 kW → **1.50 MW** → **13,140 MWh/year**  
**B) 3,000-store fleet:** 3,000 × 1.0 kW → **3.00 MW** → **26,280 MWh/year**

**Reference electricity prices:** U.S. commercial average **$0.1415/kWh (Jul 2025)**; representative global rates **$0.16–$0.20/kWh**.

## What RNS Changes (Mechanisms)

- **Polling & retry suppression:** throttle low-yield health checks; gate duplicate model calls; batch POS analytics.  
- **Content/refresh windows:** schedule signage updates and model refresh to off-peak; leverage sleep states on idle displays.  
- **Vision inference pacing:** align camera FPS/model passes to footfall; downshift at low flow.  
- **Repair-first retries:** localize site faults before triggering chain-wide retries.

---

## Why These Numbers Hold (Evidence)

- **Displays/signage:** ENERGY STAR & manufacturer specs show substantial savings from dimming, sleep, and scheduling; per-screen draw often **100–250 W**, compounding across fleets.  
- **POS/edge compute:** Enterprise endpoints and edge servers exhibit the **energy-proportional gap**—meaningful draw at low utilization—making consolidation and sleep effective.  
- **Tariff & carbon anchors:** U.S. **14.15¢/kWh (Jul 2025)**; **0.393 kg CO₂/kWh** U.S. average; swap local tariffs and **IEA** intensities as needed.

## Global Energy & Carbon Context (Drop-in)

At **10% adoption** of RNS metabolic control across retail edge fleets, **~15–20 TWh/year** and **~9–12 MtCO₂e** are avoided globally—roughly **2.0–2.6 million cars** off-road annually.
