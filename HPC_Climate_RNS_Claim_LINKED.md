## Executive Summary

Operational weather prediction and climate modeling run **ensembles** on fixed schedules (00/06/12/18Z), re-submitting **full member sets** even when **data drift is low** and **information gain is marginal**. **RNS ensemble gating** and **rhythmic scheduling** reduce redundant members, right-size physics depth, and shift non-urgent jobs to efficient windows. Modeled on a **15 MW HPC facility**, **10–30% energy cuts** yield **multi-million-dollar annual savings** and proportional **CO₂ reductions**, with no change to hardware or numerical core—only when to run, how deep, and why.

## Why These Numbers Hold (Evidence)

- **Ensemble scale is massive:** Centers like **ECMWF** and **NOAA NCEP** run **dozens of members** multiple times daily; even **single-digit member cuts** or **reduced-resolution members** at low drift translate into large kWh savings.  
- **HPC power reality:** Top exascale-class systems (e.g., ORNL **Frontier**) operate at **multi–tens of MW**; many national weather/climate centers report **multi-MW draws**. Reducing duty cycles creates immediate savings.  
- **Energy-proportional gap:** HPC nodes consume substantial **idle/low-load power**; **rhythmic scheduling** consolidates loads and frees idle windows for deeper sleep and cooling trims.  
- **Tariff & carbon anchors:** U.S. **14.15¢/kWh (Jul 2025)**; **0.393 kg CO₂/kWh** U.S. average. Swap local tariffs and **IEA** carbon intensities for location-based accounting.

## Global Energy & Carbon Context (Drop-in)

At **10% adoption** of RNS ensemble gating across global HPC/weather fleets, the world avoids **~15–20 TWh/year** and **~9–12 MtCO₂e**, equivalent to **~2.0–2.6 million cars** removed annually (see reusable block).
