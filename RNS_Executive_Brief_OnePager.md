# RNS Executive Brief — Coherent AI That Saves Millions

**What it is:** The Recursive Nervous System (RNS™) converts cognition into a metabolic control problem. It paces depth, prunes speculation, and repairs before waste accrues.

**Why it matters (numbers):**
- **Energy**: Modeled kWh reduction **25–45%** under noisy workloads.
- **Tokens/Retrievals**: **30–60%** fewer unnecessary tokens and vector reads.
- **Power spend**: For 10,000 H100 GPUs at PUE≈1.56, electricity alone is **~$8.9–13.5M/yr**; RNS (−30% kWh) saves **~$2.7–4.0M/yr**.
- **Carbon**: Baseline **~37.6 kt CO₂/yr** → RNS cut **~11.3 kt/yr** at −30% kWh.
- **Latency/Throughput**: Fewer retries and smaller context windows → faster answers at lower cost.

**How it works (plain):**
- **LMC+™ (Metabolism):** Ω = μ²·REM/TRX controls cadence; complexity is earned, not assumed.
- **DriftLock (DL_meta):** RIS = (repair − drift + anchor) routes to REPAIR before confident emission.
- **LSK+™ (Conscience):** Every consequential action ships with a CJP Why-Line; unjustified retries are blocked.
- **Symbolic Continuity (Soul):** Preserves a durable self and long-range arcs; no confidence theater.

**Where to turn it on:**
- HealthGate + DriftLock for **EMIT/HOLD/REPAIR/SYNC** gating.
- Pacing controllers tie **branch depth, passes, and context span** to budget.
- Retrieval governor caches, deduplicates, and suppresses low-gain fetches under high Ω.
- CJP Dashboard for real-time audit (Ω, ELR, RIS, Why-Lines).

**Business impact (typical):**
- Modest scale (1k GPUs): **~$0.28–0.41M/yr** in power, **~3.1 kt CO₂/yr** avoided.
- Mid-scale (5k): **~$1.33–2.03M/yr**, **~5.7 kt CO₂/yr**.
- Hyperscale (10k): **~$2.67–4.05M/yr**, **~11.3 kt CO₂/yr**.

**Call to action:** Pilot RNS on 5–10% of traffic. Instrument kWh, tokens, reads, and CJP traces; scale on proof.
