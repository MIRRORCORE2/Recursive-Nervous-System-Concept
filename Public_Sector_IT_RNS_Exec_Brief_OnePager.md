# Executive Brief — RNS for Public Sector IT (State & Federal)  
**One Page | For Budget & Oversight Committees**  
**Date:** October 23, 2025

---

## What’s the problem?
Agencies run **fixed‑cadence** jobs and **duplicated** scans across data centers and hybrid clouds. This wastes electricity and dollars, and it stresses the grid during peaks.

## What’s the fix?
**RNS metabolic control** ties energy to control. It **gates** low‑yield jobs (when drift is low), **rhythmically schedules** non‑urgent work to off‑peak windows, and produces **auditable Why‑Lines** for every decision.

## What’s the value?
- **Electricity:** **15–30%** reduction in targeted scope (primary **8 MW** + secondary **3 MW** facility).  
- **Budget:** **Multi‑million‑dollar** annual savings; additional cloud‑rent savings from avoided runs.  
- **Carbon:** Proportional **CO₂e** cuts; supports **state/federal climate goals**.  
- **Risk:** Maintains mission SLOs; rapid rollback; full observability.

## What do you need from us?
1) Approve a **90‑day pilot** on non‑mission‑critical workloads.  
2) Use the **procurement boilerplate** (SOW, KPIs/SLAs, M&V) to ensure accountability.  
3) Direct CIO/CISO/CFO/Facilities to form a **steering committee** and meet monthly.

## Why trust this?
- Aligns with **OMB DCOI** and **DOE FEMP** energy‑efficiency policies.  
- Uses proven levers behind **PUE** and **cooling** reductions.  
- Transparent **CJP Why‑Lines** for oversight and audit.
