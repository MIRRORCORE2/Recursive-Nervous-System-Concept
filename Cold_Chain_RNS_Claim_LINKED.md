# Cold Chain & Food Logistics Claim — RNS Metabolic Control for Refrigeration & Routing  
**Public Claim of Origination | Number-Heavy Economics**

## Executive Summary

Cold storage and food logistics are dominated by **refrigeration power** and **motor-driven systems** (fans, pumps, compressors), with edge compute for WMS/vision increasingly always-on. **RNS metabolic control** reduces **over-sampling/over-computing** and directly **paces equipment duty**: coordinated defrost, setpoint trims under stability, and **repair-first** actions to stop runaway cycling. Modeled **10–30% energy cuts** deliver **seven-figure annual savings** across campuses and regional networks.

## Baselines

**A) Refrigerated warehouse campus:** 3.0 MW continuous → **26,280 MWh/year**  
**B) Regional distribution network:** 6 × 1.0 MW → **52,560 MWh/year**

**Reference electricity prices:** U.S. commercial average **$0.1415/kWh (Jul 2025)**; representative global rates **$0.16–$0.20/kWh**.

## What RNS Changes (Mechanisms)

- **Setpoint & duty pacing:** small °C trims and speed reductions produce large kWh via compressor/fan affinity laws.  
- **Defrost & door-cycle coordination:** align to **low-load** windows; reduce simultaneous heat loads.  
- **Routing + warehouse cadence:** shape arrivals & picks to avoid peak refrigeration & conveyor duty; shift non-urgent compute off-peak.  
- **Repair-first retries:** localize leaks/sensor faults before system-wide retries.

## Why These Numbers Hold (Evidence)

- **DOE/AMO & Better Plants** show **double-digit savings** with controls, VFDs, and setpoint/defrost optimization in cold storage.  
- **ASHRAE & IIAR** guidance emphasizes system curves, variable speed, and coordinated defrost for large reductions.  
- **Electricity & carbon anchors:** U.S. **$0.1415/kWh (Jul 2025)**; **0.393 kg CO₂/kWh** U.S. average; swap local tariffs/IEA factors for location-based accounting.

## Global Energy & Carbon Context (Drop-in)

At **10% adoption** of RNS metabolic control across cold chains, **~15–20 TWh/year** and **~9–12 MtCO₂e** are avoided globally—roughly **2.0–2.6 million cars** off-road annually.
