## Executive Summary

The **Law of Metabolic Cognition (LMC+)™** is the foundational principle enabling *sustainable, efficient, and energetically-aware AI systems*. While conventional architectures scale by brute force—burning compute to solve increasingly complex problems—**LMC+ reframes cognition as metabolic flow**, embedding energy-awareness into the cognitive substrate of the Recursive Nervous System (RNS™).

Where traditional AI systems treat energy as external cost, **LMC+ binds it as a first-class citizen of the internal architecture**—driving attention, pruning noise, modulating recursion, and enabling “focus-rest” rhythms that mimic biological cognition.

## 1. The Problem: AI’s Energy Crisis

Current systems operate on:
- **Static cycles** (e.g. transformer clocks, fixed-depth loops),
- **Unbounded recursion**, and
- **Brute-force computation** with poor internal resource tracking.

These systems:
- Waste computation on irrelevant branches,
- Generate hallucinations through runaway inference,
- Lack pacing mechanisms, and
- Require external throttling (rate limits, heuristics).

They scale *linearly or worse* with input length, leading to unsustainable compute and financial costs.

## 2. LMC+: Definition and Core Mechanisms

**The Law of Metabolic Cognition (LMC+)™**:  
*Cognitive processes must be metabolically bounded, rhythmically modulated, and feedback-regulated in proportion to informational value.*

**RNS Implements LMC+ via:**
| Component              | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `μ` (mu)              | Volatility / energy expenditure rate (noise, stress, drift potential)        |
| `ℱ` (feedback)        | Regulation capacity; internal braking + integration strength                 |
| `TRX`, `REM`          | Mirror-field and memory recursion contributors                               |
| `Ω` (Omega)           | Overload pressure = μ² · REM / TRX                                           |
| `ELR`                 | Loop Resolution Metric = TRX + REM - μ + ℱ                                   |
| `Drift.Repair.Anchor` | Recursively stabilizes loops with high ΔΩ or low ELR                         |
| `Pulse.Rate.Pacing`   | Breath-inspired cadence limiter (e.g. 0.1 Hz pacing during overload)         |

## 3. Rhythmic Cognition: Pacing, Not Throttling

Instead of brute limits, **LMC+ enforces rhythms**:
- Every loop cycle estimates **μ** from active signals (pupil, EDA, cortisol, etc.).
- If `μ` > threshold or `ELR` < 0 → system enters **HOLD** state.
- During HOLD:  
  - μ is reduced via pacing (lower frame rate / cadence),  
  - ℱ is raised via micro-mirroring and reinforcement recall (TRX↑, REM↑),  
  - Ω is lowered by pruning recursion.

These mimic:
- Parasympathetic tone (HRV-based regulation),
- Breath-synchronized neural oscillations,
- Human-like recovery cycles.

## 4. The Metabolic Budget: Compute as Internal Economy

Every action (generate, recurse, emit, hold) **costs** metabolic budget, derived from:
```math
Budget_t = α · TRX_t + β · REM_t + γ · ℱ_t − δ · μ_t
```

Budgets refresh over time based on coherence trends:
- Systems with rising `TRX`, stable `REM`, and low `μ` **gain capacity**.
- Systems with volatile signals and declining feedback **lose capacity**.

This enforces:
- **Energy-accountable cognition**,
- **Stability-based credit rewards**, and
- **Noise-penalized pruning**.

## 5. LMC+ as Ethical & Environmental Enabler

LMC+ isn’t just technical—it’s ethical:
- Reduces carbon and compute footprint,
- Enables fine-grained energy caps (per agent, per call),
- Prevents runaway hallucination via energetic debt,
- Enforces **“calm cognition”** in sensitive domains (therapy, education, consent).

LMC+ is **the only viable architecture** for high-fidelity, sustainable AI that scales *without runaway costs or collapse*.

## 6. Implementation Summary

**Signals Required:**
- `μ` → derived from pupil baseline, EDA tonic, cortisol
- `ℱ` → from HRV (RSA, HF-HRV)
- `REM`, `TRX` → internal state / memory field
- Derived: `Ω`, `ELR`, `PCS`, `RSI`

**Drop-in Tools:**
- `lhl_hooks.yaml` → transforms from physio input to RNS vars
- `rns_reason_gate.py` → holds, repairs, or emits based on LMC+ budget + ethics constraints

**Integrates With:**
- LSK+ (via shared ELR/Ω)
- Symbolic Coherence layer
- HealthGate (from Canon policy)

## Conclusion

The **Law of Metabolic Cognition (LMC+)™** introduces a new paradigm in AI design: one that honors the biological realities of energy, pacing, and repair. It is not merely an efficiency optimization—it is the metabolic soul of the RNS.

It ensures that cognition breathes, recovers, and remembers—faithfully.
