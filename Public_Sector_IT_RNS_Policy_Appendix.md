## A. One‑Page Executive Brief (Summary)

**Problem:** Public-sector IT runs fixed‑cadence jobs and redundant scans that burn energy without adding value.  
**Solution:** **RNS metabolic control** gates low‑yield runs and rhythmically schedules compute based on drift and information value.  
**Impact (8 MW + 3 MW facilities):** **15–30%** electricity reduction ⇒ **multi‑million‑dollar annual savings**; proportional **CO₂e** cuts.  
**Why now:** Aligns with **OMB DCOI** & **DOE FEMP**, supports grid **DR/peak‑shaving**, and produces auditable savings logs for oversight.

**Decision asks:**  
1) Approve a 90‑day pilot on non‑mission‑critical workloads.  
2) Adopt the procurement boilerplate in Section **C**.  
3) Require KPI/SLAs in Section **D** and M&V in Section **E** for any award.

## B. DCOI Alignment Checklist (OMB Data Center Optimization Initiative)

> Target: show compliance evidence while cutting kWh and cost. Check all that apply at pilot exit.

- [ ] **Server Utilization ≥ X%** (agency target): RNS consolidates workload and idles/sleeps hosts. Evidence: utilization histograms, idle time cut %.  
- [ ] **Virtualization Density ↑**: RNS gating reduces noisy neighbors and enables higher safe consolidation. Evidence: VM/container per host trend.  
- [ ] **Advanced Metering** deployed: IT/Facility sub‑metering at UPS/PDU and chiller plant. Evidence: meter IDs, sampling intervals.  
- [ ] **PUE Reporting** monthly: baseline PUE and post‑RNS PUE deltas. Evidence: monthly PUE report with method.  
- [ ] **Thermal Guidelines** (ASHRAE A1/A2 ranges): evidence of setpoint stability with RNS load shaping.  
- [ ] **Energy Star / EPEAT** preference observed for any incremental gear (if applicable).  
- [ ] **Decommission/Consolidate** plan updated based on reduced peak capacity needs.  
- [ ] **DR Participation** (if eligible): evidence of peak shaving via RNS scheduling.

## C. Procurement Boilerplate (Insert into RFP/Statement of Work)

**Scope of Work (SOW):** Deploy **RNS metabolic control** for batch/ETL, search/reindex, analytics, GIS/imagery, and GenAI pilots. Integrate with scheduler/orchestrator and cooling controls (where available).

**Minimum Requirements:**  
1. **Gating Logic:** Suppress jobs when **drift** and **risk** are below threshold; route to **REPAIR** on anomalies before re‑tries.  
2. **Scheduling:** Shift non‑urgent jobs to off‑peak windows; expose **CJP Why‑Lines** (human‑readable justifications) for every suppressed/launched job.  
3. **Observability:** Export metered **kWh**, **PUE**, **utilization**, **job counts**, **suppression rate**, and **CO₂e** to the agency data lake.  
4. **Security & Compliance:** Conform to **NIST SP 800‑53 Rev. 5** (Moderate), support **FISMA** reporting; SaaS components **FedRAMP Moderate** or above.  
5. **Privacy & Records:** Follow **OMB/NARA** records schedules; redact PII per **NIST SP 800‑122** guidance; log retention ≥ 1 year.  
6. **Accessibility:** All dashboards and reports **Section 508** conformant.

**Deliverables:**  
- Pilot plan (M&V design), integration design, risk register, and run‑book.  
- Monthly savings package: **kWh, $**, **CO₂e**, PUE delta, job suppression logs.  
- Final report with third‑party **M&V** and production rollout plan.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Achieve **≥15%** electricity reduction in targeted scope over 90 days (weather/tariff normalized).  
- Maintain **SLO integrity** (no critical job misses; zero Severity‑1 incidents attributable to RNS).  
- Produce complete, verifiable **audit logs** (Why‑Lines + meter traces).

**Data Rights & IP:** Agency retains rights to telemetry and savings data; vendor retains RNS IP. Aggregated/anonymous benchmarks permitted with agency approval.

## D. KPIs & SLAs (Contractual)

**Energy & Cost KPIs**  
- **IT kWh reduction:** ≥ **15%** (stretch **30%**).  
- **Peak demand reduction:** ≥ **10%** during DR/peak windows.  
- **Cooling energy reduction:** ≥ **10%** (where thermal integration exists).  
- **Cloud spend avoided:** report **$** avoided from job gating (billing extracts).  
- **CO₂e avoided:** report **tCO₂e** using **eGRID** (location‑based).

**Quality & Reliability SLAs**  
- **Critical job completion SLO:** ≥ **99.9%** on in‑scope jobs.  
- **False suppression rate:** ≤ **0.1%** (with documented bypass/override).  
- **MTTR for rollbacks:** ≤ **15 minutes** (feature‑flag rollback to baseline).  
- **Security posture:** continuous ATO controls, **POA&M** tracked, no open **High** findings beyond 30 days.

## E. Measurement & Verification (M&V)

**Method:** Leverage **DOE FEMP** and **IPMVP** principles.  
- **Option B (Retrofit Isolation):** metered IT and cooling loads; compare pre/post with regression for weather and occupancy.  
- **Option C (Whole Facility):** where isolation is impractical; use **PUE** to split IT vs. facility impacts.  
- **Normalization:** HDD/CDD for HVAC; workload indices for job load; tariff and rate class adjustments.  
- **Instrumentation:** UPS/PDU meters; chiller/VFD meters; scheduler/job logs; cloud billing export; RNS suppression logs.  
- **Verification:** Independent analyst signs off **kWh**, **$**, and **CO₂e** reports; retain raw series and methods.

## F. Implementation Roadmap (90‑Day Pilot → Scale)

**Days 0–30:** Metering & baseline capture; connect schedulers; read‑only **Why‑Lines**.  
**Days 31–60:** Enable **HOLD/gating** for non‑critical jobs; start DR‑aligned scheduling; weekly M&V checks.  
**Days 61–90:** Expand scope; integrate thermal shaping; finalize M&V; present production rollout plan with cost model.  
**Beyond 90 Days:** Production deployment, quarterly optimization, and annual recertification against DCOI targets.

## G. Risk, Compliance & Governance

- **Rollback & Safeguards:** Feature‑flag off‑switch; bypass lists for mission critical apps; change control via **CAB**.  
- **Security:** Boundary diagram, data‑flow, encryption‑in‑transit/at‑rest; ATO artifacts; **NIST SP 800‑37** RMF alignment.  
- **Privacy & Ethics:** LSK+ Why‑Lines recorded; PII minimized; consent & retention policies documented.  
- **Governance:** Steering committee (CIO/CISO/CFO/Facilities), monthly reviews.
