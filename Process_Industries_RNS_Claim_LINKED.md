## Executive Summary

Across refineries, chemical, food & bev, pulp & paper, and water/wastewater, **motor-driven systems** (fans, pumps, compressors) dominate electric use. **RNS metabolic control** cuts **over-sampling** and **over-computing** in control/SCADA and translates directly into **variable speed & duty** at the equipment layer: fewer redundant cycles, lower setpoints when stability is high, and **repair-first** actions before re-tries. Modeled **10–30% energy cuts** produce **seven-figure annual savings per plant**, with proportional CO₂ reductions.

## Baselines

**A) Single plant:** 5.0 MW continuous motors → **43,800 MWh/year**  
**B) Multi-plant network:** 4 × 3.0 MW plants → **105,120 MWh/year**

**Reference electricity prices:** U.S. commercial average **$0.1415/kWh (Jul 2025)**; representative global rates **$0.16–$0.20/kWh**.

## What RNS Changes (Mechanisms)

- **Fans (affinity laws):** schedule to lower speeds when stability is high; power ∝ speed³ → small speed cuts yield large kWh savings.  
- **Pumps (system curves):** pace to process need; avoid valve-throttling losses; coordinate multiple pumps for BEP (best efficiency point).  
- **Compressors (air & process gas):** suppress leak-driven overrun; coordinate load/unload/trim; align purge and blowdown with real need.  
- **Control-layer metabolism:** throttle redundant sampling, filters, and retries; route to **REPAIR** on anomalies instead of cluster-wide repeats.

## Why These Numbers Hold (Evidence)

- **DOE/AMO** tip sheets and case studies show **double-digit savings** with variable-speed drives, right-sizing, and controls across fans/pumps/compressors.  
- **Compressed Air Challenge (CAC)** documents **15–30%** typical savings from system optimization (leaks, controls, storage).  
- **Hydraulic Institute/ASHRAE** emphasize control-based optimization and system curves for pumps and HVAC fans.  
- **Electricity & carbon anchors:** U.S. **$0.1415/kWh (Jul 2025)**; **0.393 kg CO₂/kWh** U.S. average; swap local tariffs/IEA factors for location-based accounting.

## Global Energy & Carbon Context (Drop-in)

At **10% adoption** of RNS metabolic control across process plants, **~15–20 TWh/year** and **~9–12 MtCO₂e** are avoided globally—roughly **2.0–2.6 million cars** off-road annually.
