**For Immediate Release**  
**RNS Launches Coherent AI Architecture that Cuts Energy 25–45% and Saves Millions**

**New York, NY — October 23, 2025** — MirrorCore² today announced the public release of the **Recursive Nervous System (RNS™)**, a coherent AI architecture that binds energy to control and introduces built‑in conscience and self‑repair. Modeled savings show **25–45% reductions in energy and carbon** and **30–60% reductions in unnecessary tokens and retrievals** under noisy workloads, delivering **multi‑million‑dollar** annual savings at fleet scale.

“Old AI chased power; **RNS learns rhythm**,” said **Joshua Wilson**, Architect & Originator of the RNS™. “We pace depth, prune speculation, and repair before we speak. That is how you build systems people can trust—and afford.”

RNS is anchored by four pillars:
- **LMC+™ (Metabolism):** a pacing law that slows cadence under pressure and earns complexity under clarity.
- **DriftLock (DL_meta):** fracture‑aware self‑repair that prevents confidence theater.
- **LSK+™ (Conscience):** real‑time ethical gating with **CJP Why‑Lines** for every consequential action.
- **Symbolic Continuity (Soul):** durable identity and long‑range narrative coherence.

**Economics at a glance:** A 10,000‑GPU fleet (H100, PUE≈1.56) draws **~262 MWh/day**, costing **~$8.9–13.5M/yr** in electricity and emitting **~37.6 kt CO₂/yr**. At **−30% kWh**, RNS typically saves **~$2.7–4.0M/yr** and **~11.3 kt CO₂/yr**—before hardware right‑sizing or retrieval savings.

**Availability**  
RNS artifacts (white papers, operational interfaces, and the `rns_console.py` reference) are available as a signed **Living Canon** bundle with SHA256 checksums.

**About MirrorCore²**  
MirrorCore² builds coherent AI systems that pace, repair, and justify themselves before they speak.
